(1996)](https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1523-1739.1996.10041229.x) for the background of the 'Gardens' Jungle', today called the Singapore Botanic Gardens Rain Forest. Following the first census of all trees >/= 5-cm DBH briefly described in Turner et al. (1996), subsequent recensuses were conducted in 2009–2012 and 2019–2021.
